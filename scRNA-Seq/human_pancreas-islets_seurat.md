# About this data



**CDS Project (if applicable):** 2020-165__Powers-scRNA-Seq-human-alpha-beta-cells

**Laboratory/source of data:** Powers and Brissova group/ Shrestha et al., JCI Insight (2021)

**Object created by:** Shristi Shrestha

**Object created on:** 2023-02-02

**Object type:** Seurat object

**Data features:** 500 cells, 26107 genes

**Description/Comments:** This seurat object contains single cell RNAseq data of human pancreatic islets from 5 healthy donors published in Shrestha et al., JCI Insight (2021). Original data profiled ~45,000 cells of whole islet tissue post quality filters. However, this seurat objects is randomly concised to 500 cells as a test dataset. Infered cell types from this  data include alpha, beta, delta, gama, acinar, ductal, stellate, endothelial and immune cells and are added to metadata column "CellTypes". Donor's age has been added to metadata column "Age". Full dataset including all cells is now available in [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7626110)
