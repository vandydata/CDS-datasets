# datasets
A convenient place to park small/test datasets

## Naming convention and metadata

Each dataset should following the following naming convention, composed of underscore-separated tokens:

```
species_samplekeyword1-samplekeyword2-samplekeyword(n)_objectype.ext
```

Tokens:
* species, eg. human, mouse, etc.
* sample keyword(s) (separate by hyphens)
* type of object/generated by eg. Seurat, DESeq2, Scanpy
* file extension

An associated descriptive markdown file should exist, per dataset. Same file name, but with `.md` extension.
